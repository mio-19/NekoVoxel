Trying to make a minetest fork with 32bit address space and 1/4 width nodes


TODO:

+ [x] 32-bit data types
+ [x] compiles
+ [ ] pass unit test
+ [ ] fix network protocol
+ [ ] replace some float usages to double: float can't represent 32bit int
+ [ ] entering devtest world
+ [ ] client rendering for 1/4 width nodes
+ [ ] patch minetest_game
